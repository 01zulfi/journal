## About

An application to get me into the habit of journaling my code, and reflect on my learning. 

This is a three repository project, the other two are:

- [Journal REST API](https://github.com/01zulfi/journal-api) - an API to manage operations with the database
- [Journal Admin](https://github.com/01zulfi/journal-admin) - where I create, update, and set posts to be published

## Technologies

- Utilize [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Implement client side routing with [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- Parse markdown with [React Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown)
    - Get Raw HTML to parse via [Rehype Raw](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-raw) 
    - Get syntax highlighting via [React Syntax Highlighter](https://github.com/react-syntax-highlighter/react-syntax-highlighter)
- Use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
